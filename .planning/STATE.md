# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** Instant mould generation from a 2D profile -- a potter draws their pot shape, and the app generates all 3D-printable mould parts with zero CAD knowledge required.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - WASM Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases at comprehensive depth, WASM spike first to de-risk CDN loading
- [Roadmap]: replicad over raw OpenCASCADE.js per research recommendation
- [Roadmap]: Paper.js for profile editor, Three.js for preview per research recommendation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: WASM CDN loading is MEDIUM confidence -- needs spike validation. If CDN fails, fallback to self-hosted WASM or raw opencascade.js@1.1.1
- [Phase 6]: Ridge/groove dimensions and clearance values need physical test prints to validate -- cannot be determined from research alone
